In order to speed up generation with MadGraph, you can restrict the couplings at the time of generation.
The speed up happens because SMEFTSim will not generate diagrams with the restricted couplings. Even if
the user specifies that the coupling is 0 in the param_card at the time of generation, Madgraph will still try to 
calculate the amplitude from each diagram, even if that value is 0, which becomes extremely inneficient for a 
model like SMEFT.

In order to restrict the masses you want, in the folder 

models/SMEFTsim_U35_alphaSchemeUFO/

one must put a version of the default param card with specific edits made

If the user wants to remove a specific coupling, the value needs to be set to exactly 0.
If the use wants to include a specific parameter, the value in the card needs to be set to some non-zero number
If the values the parameters are set to are the same value i.e cHWB = 1 and cHW = 1, the values of these couplings will be
forced to be equivalent by the generator. So for each independent coupling the value in the param card must be unique.

An example card to restrict SMEFTSim in the SM limit is included in this directory named: restrict_qqH_SM_limit.dat

To use the restrict card when the user imports the model:

for some card named : <name>.dat
import model SMEFTsim_U35_alphaSchemeUFO-<name>
